## Prospective students
Our work lies at the intersection of data science, optimization, and manufacturing AI. I am happy to work with students with academic ambitions who are eager to explore these areas.

If you are a current Northwestern student and currently looking for research opportunities, feel free to reach out to me via email. We welcome students from all backgrounds who are passionate about advancing research frontiers.

For prospective students not yet affiliated with Northwestern, the best way to apply is through the [IEMS Ph.D. program](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/academics/phd/) or the [ME Ph.D. program](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/academics/graduate/prospective-phd/). If you have any questions about our research or the application process, don't hesitate to reach out. Notice that the Ph.D. admission is determined by committee and I cannot make decisions on my own.

Our lab also welcomes visiting graduate and undergraduate students for research projects.
