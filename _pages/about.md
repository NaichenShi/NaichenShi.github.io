About me
======

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering at the University of Michigan advised by [Dr. Raed Al Kontar](https://alkontar.engin.umich.edu/). My research is driven by the need for novel statistical and optimization methodologies addressing scientific and engineering challenges across diverse domains, including the Internet of Things, smart manufacturing, and spatial transcriptomics. I am also interested in investigating the theoretical underpinnings of these methods. In particular, my current research in <span style="color:#bf8f78">personalized, collaborative, and decentralized</span> data analytics explores computational techniques to integrate knowledge from multiple sources and build tailored machine-learning models.

When data are collected from multiple related but heterogeneous sources, can we integrage the common information among these sources and identify the unique feature in each source?
